## ECSE-324: Computer Organization


- These assignments were part of **ECSE-324** - Computer Organization Course at **McGill University**.
- Final Grade: **A**

---

### Lab 1: **Basic Assembly Language Programming**  
Covered **function calling conventions**, recursion, and low-level implementation of algorithms like exponentiation, factorial, and quicksort in ARM assembly. Focused on subroutine management, including stack usage, argument passing, and optimizing common computational tasks.

---

### Lab 2: **I/O Programming and Timer Interrupts**  
Explored **memory-mapped I/O** to interface with peripherals like LEDs, HEX displays, and pushbuttons, and implemented both polling-based and interrupt-based applications. Focused on configuring hardware timers and handling asynchronous events using the ARM Generic Interrupt Controller (GIC).

### Lab 3: **Keyboard and VGA Drivers**  
Covered the development of **drivers for complex I/O devices**, including a VGA display and PS/2 keyboard, to handle graphical output and input processing. Emphasized integration of multiple subsystems to create an interactive application, combining graphics rendering and keyboard-based navigation.
